ClassCastException 

ClassCastException:
 It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence
  it is an unchecked exception. 
  This exception is rise automatically
   by JVM whenever we try to improperly typecast a class from
    one type to another
     i.e when we’re trying to typecast parent object to 
     child type or when we try to typecast an object to a subclass
      of which it is not an instance.

In the below program we create an object
 o of type Object and typecasting that object o to a String object s.
  As we know that Object class is the parent class of all classes 
  in java and as we’re trying to typecast a parent object to its child type 
  then ultimately we get java
.lang.ClassCastException
